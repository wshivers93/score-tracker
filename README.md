## Score Tracker

Project for the [2022 AWS Amplify x Hashnode](https://townhall.hashnode.com/aws-amplify-hackathon?source=discord) Hackathon.

## Goal
Goal of the project is to provide users a quick and easy way to check live scores for sporting events.
For a more personal experience, will allow users to create an account and subscribe to their favorite teams. Their favorite teams will appear at the top of the home page so they are easier to find.

## Stretch Goal for Hackathon
I would also like to create a discord bot to connect to the backend of this site, so users can recieve notifications to their discord servers about score updates for their favorite teams.
